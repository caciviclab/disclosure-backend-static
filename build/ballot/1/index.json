I want to ensure that the American Dream of my parents’ generation remains possible for my newborn son, Austin. \n\nMy parents took a leap of blind faith when they came to this country as immigrants from India in 1978. They were able to purchase a modest home in a Southern California suburb, and that’s where the American Dream unfolded for our family. I was blessed to attend solid public schools in a safe neighborhood, earn a bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 2005 and then a master’s degree in public policy from U.C. Berkeley in 2012. But today, for so many members of our community, it feels like the Berkeley version of the American Dream is becoming harder to grasp. \n\nAs your councilmember, I would build on my experience serving on Berkeley’s Housing Advisory Commission and Community Health Commission, where I’ve championed affordable housing and preventing the closure of Alta Bates Hospital. I would also draw on my professional background in policy analysis and public budgeting. After earning a Master of Public Policy from U.C. Berkeley, I spent three years in Sacramento working for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, where I advised the state legislature on budget and policy issues. I now work as a Finance Manager for the San Francisco Human Services Agency, which provides safety net programs to low-income individuals and families. In my role, I ensure that the agency’s $900 million annual operating budget remains in balance. \n\nI look forward to using my unique perspective and experience to be a new voice for our North Berkeley community. Among my top priorities are housing, homelessness, public safety, transportation infrastructure, as well as parks and open space.\n\nSource: http://www.rashi2018.org/meetrashi/",
