          "bio": "I’m running for City Council in District 1 as a new mom and a first-time homeowner who is deeply invested in the future of our community. I want to ensure that the American Dream of my parents’ generation remains possible for my newborn son, Austin. \n\nMy parents took a leap of blind faith when they came to this country as immigrants from India in 1978. They were able to purchase a modest home in a Southern California suburb, and that’s where the American Dream unfolded for our family. I was blessed to attend solid public schools in a safe neighborhood, earn a bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 2005 and then a master’s degree in public policy from U.C. Berkeley in 2012. But today, for so many members of our community, it feels like the Berkeley version of the American Dream is becoming harder to grasp. \n\nAs your councilmember, I would build on my experience serving on Berkeley’s Housing Advisory Commission and Community Health Commission, where I’ve championed affordable housing and preventing the closure of Alta Bates Hospital. I would also draw on my professional background in policy analysis and public budgeting. After earning a Master of Public Policy from U.C. Berkeley, I spent three years in Sacramento working for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, where I advised the state legislature on budget and policy issues. I now work as a Finance Manager for the San Francisco Human Services Agency, which provides safety net programs to low-income individuals and families. In my role, I ensure that the agency’s $900 million annual operating budget remains in balance. \n\nI look forward to using my unique perspective and experience to be a new voice for our North Berkeley community. Among my top priorities are housing, homelessness, public safety, transportation infrastructure, as well as parks and open space.\n\nSource: http://www.rashi2018.org/meetrashi/",

          "bio": "Combining my artistic and pragmatic sides, I came to Berkeley in 2002 to study architecture at UC Berkeley. Since graduating, I've worked for architects in the Bay Area, designing apartments, public infrastructure, home additions, businesses, and more.\n\nI entered politics through the trash room door, starting out as a Waste Reduction Coordinator in the Berkeley Student Cooperative, where I audited dumpsters and put together support and financing for the Co-op's first photovoltaic solar panel array.  Presently, I serve on the City of Berkeley's Zero Waste Commission and also as the chair of the Sierra Club San Francisco Bay Chapter's Zero Waste Committee.  I've worked on reducing plastic use and litter, organizing activists to fight methane-emitting garbage grinders, expanding multi-stream recycling that ensures that recovered paper and plastics have willing buyers and second lives, and am presently looking at policies to encourage the reuse of buildings and their component materials. \n\nThroughout my political career, the Zero Waste goal of highest and best use has been a guide, as has the everyday reality of taking out the garbage/compost/recycling, an ever present reminder that while working towards a better world, maintaining the functions of daily life cannot be neglected. \n\nIn the last several years as the Bay Area flipped out of the frying pan of the recession and into the fire of the housing crisis, I have worked on efforts to zone for more housing, fund affordable housing, and expand rent control and other tenant protections.  Some say we need to increase supply.  Some say we need stronger rent control.  I say, \"Why Not Both\" \n\nI am fired up by the challenges I've seen not just my generation, but low and moderate income people of all ages face; yet grounded in economic reality with a business degree and professional experience.  Having a dozen years of experience designing housing, I know how to find elegant solutions for a Berkeley that is affordable, not dependent on fossil fuels, safer, and capable of being achieved in the next few years.\n\nSource: https://www.alfred2018.com/about",
