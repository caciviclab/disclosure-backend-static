This measure amends the City Charter to eliminate the requirement that the City's official newspaper be printed and published in the City of Oakland and have a daily circulation of at least 25,000. Further, it requires the City Council, by ordinance, to establish new procedures for designating the City's official newspaper to publish legal and other notices required by the Oakland City Charter and other laws.
