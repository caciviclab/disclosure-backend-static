This measure would amend the Charter to increase the term the City Council can lease City-owned or City-controlled real property to a maximum of ninety-nine (99) years. The Oakland City Charter currently authorizes the City Council to lease real property owned or controlled by the City of Oakland for a maximum term of sixty-six (66) years. (City Charter Section 1001).
